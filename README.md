# JavaXO
This is a simple Tic-tac-toe game. I made this project to introduce myself to Java for the first time.

Seek no use for that code as its completely nonsensical and overcomplicated.

TODO:
* Base class structure ✅
* Data structure ✅
* Input dialogue
* Output ~✅
* Win/Lose algorithm
* Bot

May be some time soon make it into spring web application??
